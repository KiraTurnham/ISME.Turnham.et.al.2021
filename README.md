## Abstract
The application of molecular genetics has reinvigorated and improved how species are defined and investigated scientifically, especially for morphologically cryptic micro-organisms. Here we show how species recognition improves understanding of the ecology and evolution of mutualisms between reef-building corals and their mutualistic dinoflagellates (i.e. Symbiodiniaceae). A combination of genetic, ecological, and morphological evidence defines two sibling species of *Cladocopium* (formerly *Symbiodinium* Clade C), specific only to host corals in the common genus *Pocillopora*, which transmit their obligate symbionts during oogenesis. *Cladocopium latusorum* sp. nov. is symbiotic with *P. grandis/meandrina* while the smaller-celled *C. pacificum* sp. nov. associates with *P. verrucosa*. Both symbiont species form mutualisms with *Pocillopora* that brood their young. Populations of each species, like their hosts, are genetically well connected across the tropical and sub-tropical Pacific Ocean, indicating a capacity for long-range dispersal. A molecular clock approximates their speciation during the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene as Earth underwent cycles of precipitous cooling and warming; and corresponds to when their hosts were also diversifying. The long temporal and spatial maintenance of high host fidelity, as well as genetic connectivity across thousands of kilometers, indicates that distinct ecological attributes and close evolutionary histories will restrain the adaptive responses of corals and their specialized symbionts to rapid climate warming.
