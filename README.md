## Files overview

### Supplemental Tables
* **Table_S1_samples.pdf** List of *Cladocopium* samples with corresponding species names, ITS2 designations, host *Pocillopora* species, country of
origin, collection site, and approximate latitude/longitude coordinates.

* **Supplemental_Tables_S2-S4.pdf** 
* S2. PCR primers and associated references for mitochondrial, nuclear, chloroplast genes and non-coding regions
* S3. *Cladocopium* microsatellite loci used in this study and corresponding allele size ranges, repeat motifs, annealing temperatures, and references
* S4. Cell size differences between *Cladocopium pacificum* and *C.latusorum* from *Pocillopora* host samples obtained in Palau. The mean length and width of ovate cells are listed based off of individual measurements of 55-110 cells per sample

### Sequence alignments
* **Supplemental_Dataset_S_concatenated_alignment.nex** *Cladocopium* concatenated nexus alignment: ITS2 LSU cp23S cob cox1
* **Supplemental_Dataset_psbA_alignment.nex** *Cladocopium* psbA nexus alignment
* **psba_alignment_mol_clock.nex** *Cladocopium* psbA nexus alignment used in molecular clock analyses (contains *Cladocopium* associated with sibling species *Porites panamensis* from Eastern Pacific and *Porites porites var. colonensi* from Western Atlantic

### MrModelTest output used in downstream Bayesian analyses
* **mr_model_test_output.txt** MrModelTest output containing Akaike Information Criterion

### Multi-locus genotypes and R scripts for microsatellite analyses
Allele freqeuncy, STRUCUTRE, and t-SNE plots were created using PlotSTR, BayesAllele, and t-SNE scripts developed by Drew Wham and available at https://github.com/DrewWham/theclonalescnet (see also Wham et al., 2016).
* **Supplemental_Dataset_microsatellites.docx** *C. pacificum* and *C. latusorum* multi-locus genotypes
* * **Supplemental_Dataset_linkage.txt** Linkage disequilibrium analysis between pairs of all microsatellite loci used for multi-locus genotyping performed using Genepop on the Web https://genepop.curtin.edu.au/)
* **PCA_TSNE_and_GMM_script.R** Script for performing principal components analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering analyses
* **bayesallele_frequency.Rmd** Script for allele frequency based on BayesAllele 
* **structureplot_K2.Rmd** Script for STRUCTURE using PlotSTR
